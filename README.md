# mars_calc

A small program demonstrating the following concepts in Rust:
 * Basic data types
 * Functions
 * Macros
 * Mutability
 * The Standard Library
 * Ownership
 * References and Borrowing

Also explored Ownership and Borrowing in GDB.

***What to know:***

All variables are immutable by default

The three ownership rules are:
 * Each value in Rust is owned by a variable
 * When the owner goes out of scope the value will be deallocated
 * There can only be one owner at a time

References can be either mutable or immutable
There can be multiple immutable references at the same time
Rust supports both signed and unsigned integers.
